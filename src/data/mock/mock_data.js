        "Mental health is an issue that has gained increasing attention in recent years, and women mental health is an important aspect of that and for good reason. The various roles which a woman plays through their lifespan and the societal pressures and expectations which come along with it play a huge role in the increased occurrence of mental health related conditions in women. The expectation to juggle multiple roles including that of a caregiver, employee and homemaker, while also maintaining a certain appearance or personality is an important contributor and the constant feeling of falling short of them can further add to the cause.",
